The color tokens within this design system encapsulates a rich palette of semantic colors, each with specific roles and shades to cater to various UI elements and states.

The `primary` colors, with shades ranging from light lavender (#faf7fd) to deep purple (#361952), form the core visual identity, suitable for branding elements and primary actions.

The `secondary` colors shift towards teal (#f0fdfa to #042f2d), providing a refreshing contrast ideal for secondary actions or highlighting important UI elements without overpowering the primary hue.

The `accent` color spectrum, from a soft peach (#fff7ed) to a dark burnt orange (#431307), is designed to draw attention to specific components or prompts, making it perfect for call-to-action buttons or interactive elements.

- The information color in a design system typically employs a clear, subdued shade, such as a light blue or gray, to convey neutral and informative messages without invoking urgency or emotion.
- The `success` shades signify positive actions or confirmations, with a vibrant green (#f1fcf2 to #082b11) that should be used to indicate completion, approval, or progress.
- The `warning` palette, transitioning from a light yellow (#fffde7) to a darker shade (#442004), is tailored for cautionary messages or to highlight areas that require user attention.
- `danger` colors range from a soft pinkish-red (#fef3f2) to a dark maroon (#490815), ideal for error messages, critical warnings, or delete actions, signaling users to proceed with caution.

Lastly, the `slate` collection, with shades from very light gray (#f6f7f9) to almost black (#23272e), provides a neutral backdrop suited for text, backgrounds, and UI frames, ensuring legibility and a muted contrast against more vibrant colors.

Additional constants like `white`, `black`, `transparent`, and `currentColor` offer foundational colors for designing with flexibility and precision, supporting a cohesive and accessible user interface across the design system.
